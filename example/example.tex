% AAUDOC is controlled using a small header in the main LaTeX
% document, as shown above, in this example is a index build
% by "link", the document compiled using "command" and the
% leftover files removed using "clean".

% A very simple preamble with just enough to test
% that AAUDOC handels both linking, compilation and BiBTex
\documentclass{article}

% As AAUDOC builds a index is the place where it is stored
% all we need to add to the preamble for all document in the
% folder to be found, and inserted into a document block
