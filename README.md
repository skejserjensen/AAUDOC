AAUDOC
======
Cross-platform implementation of the (in)famous compile-doc for collaborative LaTeX document compilation.

NOTE: this is a development repository and not intended for use by external parties.

TODO
----
* Support for multiple input documents 
* Support for automatic linking of documents through
* Addition of user defined header Macros, so Jobs could be bundled
* Pretty printing of output from commands and parsing of it for errors
* Error handling should be a bit more sophisticated then just catching and hiding
* The program should be restructured into sub components instead of just one file
