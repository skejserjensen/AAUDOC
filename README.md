AAUDOC
======
Cross-platform implementation of the (in)famous compile-doc for collaborative LaTeX document compilation.

NOTE: this is a development repository and not intended for use by external parties.    

TODO
----
* Make errors in the header of TeX files non terminating, so a file can fail while the rest is ok 
* Go through the program and simplify the code where possible, refactoring at the same time.
* Investigate how to set the path appropriately to correct "bibtex: (openout_any = p)" errors.
